# App Demonstration
A 2019 Technology Assessment for Kristi Centinaro

This project is meant to demonstrate an example of how to develop a large scale front end application using frameworks and methodology that are prized today.
In 10 years I hope to look on this fondly, and with a smidgen of PTSD, much like I do my Backbone/Marionette apps ... :)


Cheers,
Kristi Centinaro
